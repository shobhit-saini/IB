/*
Max Heap is a special kind of complete binary tree in which for every node the value present in that node is greater than the value present in itâ€™s children nodes. If you want to know more about Heaps, please visit this link

So now the problem statement for this question is:

How many distinct Max Heap can be made from n distinct integers

In short, you have to ensure the following properties for the max heap :

Heap has to be a complete binary tree ( A complete binary tree is a binary tree in which every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes are as far left as possible. )
Every node is greater than all its children
Let us take an example of 4 distinct integers. Without loss of generality let us take 1 2 3 4 as our 4 distinct integers

Following are the possible max heaps from these 4 numbers :

         4 
       /  \ 
      3   2 
     / 
    1
         4 
       /  \ 
      2   3 
     / 
    1
        4 
       /  \ 
      3   1 
     / 
    2
These are the only possible 3 distinct max heaps possible for 4 distinct elements.

Implement the below function to return the number of distinct Max Heaps that is possible from n distinct elements.

As the final answer can be very large output your answer modulo 1000000007

Input Constraints : n <= 100
